The ego-car starts to decelerate and comes to a stop. The cause of this appears to be due to a hazard blocking the road ahead leading to a stop in the flow of traffic. This suggests the presence of an unexpected event, possibly an accident, road closure, or heavy congestion farther ahead. The ego-car driver responds appropriately by braking and stopping their vehicle to ensure safety for themselves and others on the road.

This could be due to the absence of any oncoming traffic or obstructions, allowing the driver to increase their speed in accordance with the speed limit.\n\nNext, the driver brings the car to a halt as they approach a red light. The street may be busy with traffic from the other direction and pedestrians might be crossing. The traffic law and the driver's responsibility for safety necessitates this stop.\n\nAfter the light turns green and it's safe to advance, the driver accelerates the car again, preparing for another right turn. Like the first turn, the driver might check for any pedestrians or road users on the right side before executing the turn to ensure safety.\n\nFinally, the driver maintains a steady speed and continues down the street as the lane in front appears to be clear with no immediate obstructions or traffic congestion.

Not too far ahead, there's a pedestrian crossing the street.\n\nThen, the ego-car, carefully navigating, starts moving again, slowly accelerates, and changes lanes from left to right - an action prompted by stationary cars in the previous lane and the need to observe the traffic in the new lane. Along these actions, there are other cars slowly making their way down the road, one of them being close to the ego-car's right side.\n\nIn the next phase, the driver accelerates as traffic clears ahead of it. Then the driver slows down and switches back to the previous lane as the car approaches a traffic-lighted intersection.
